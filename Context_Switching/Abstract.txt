The Context_Switching project is to demonstrate how to context switch between two privileged tasks.
The Context_SwitchingT program is available in different targets:

 - CS SIM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Configured for simulator debugger

 - CS RAM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Runs from Internal RAM located on chip
     (may be used for target debugging)

There are two tasks in the system: priv_task1 and priv_task2. Both output to COM1.

The COM1 terminal uses polling mechanism and outputs the debugging messages when DEBUG_0 macro is defined.
The privileged priv_task1 and priv_task2 outputs to the debugging terminal..

Expected behavior:

priv_task1 and priv_task2  switch between each other after six lines are printed.
priv_task1 prints six lines of upper case letters. Each line repeats a letter 5 times.
priv_task2 prints six lines of digits. Each line repeats a single digit 5 times.

Note there is a dummy loop added to introduce some delay.
