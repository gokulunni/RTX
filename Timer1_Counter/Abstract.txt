The Timer1_counter program is to demonstrate how to program timer1 as a free-running counter without triggering an interrupt.
The Timer1_counter program is available in different targets:

 - Timer Counter SIM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Configured for simulator debugger

 - Timer Counter RAM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Runs from Internal RAM located on chip
     (may be used for target debugging)

Expected behavior: 
Prints Timer1 TC and PC counter values for measured operations on uart1 polling terminal.
