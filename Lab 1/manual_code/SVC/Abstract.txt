The SVC project is a skeleton file for RTX memory management system calls
for the NXP 'LPC1768' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - UART1 outputs a few memory management system calls debugging messages.

The SVC program is available in different targets:

 - SVC SIM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Configured for simulator debugger
   
 - SVC RAM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Runs from Internal RAM located on chip
     (may be used for target debugging)
